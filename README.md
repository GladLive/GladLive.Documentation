# What is GladLive?

GladLive is network service comparable to Xboxlive or Steam for .Net applications. It's designed for distributed use with an emphasis on scalability. It provides core serives any online game requires such as:
  - Authentication*
  - Patching*
  - Profiles*
  - Lobby*
  - Chat (voice/message)
  - Matchmaking
  - Web*

(* denotes the service already exists or is partially implemented)

## How does GladLive work?

GladLive is primarily based on HTTP and the new crossplatform ASP core platform. The choice of HTTP was simply due to the availablity of technologies that allow HTTP to scale and the ability to utilize the same services to service Web requests.

Yes, that's right. GladLive can function in your application/game **and** service your web back-end and front-end needs in a single application.
